tutorial_newproject_intro:
  other: |
    The State Tool lets you create and maintain a set of virtual environments (eg., one per project), allowing you to
    isolate and better manage language versions and dependencies on a per-project basis.
    [[BR]][[BR]]
    For every virtual environment, you'll be able to share the current configuration (language version & dependencies)
    with your teammates so everyone stays in sync, as well as share secrets (or store your own, for your eyes only),
    set up shared scripts, and much more.
    [[BR]][[BR]]
    We'll help you create your first virtual environment, after that you can create as many as you want by running
    '[ACTIONABLE]state init[/RESET]'.

    You can also manage your project in your browser at [ACTIONABLE]{{.URL}}[/RESET].

    To create another project run '[ACTIONABLE]state init[/RESET]', or if you want to find out more about the State Tool and what it can do

ppm_convert_explanation:
  other: |
    State Tool, like Perl 7, is being developed from the ground up with modern software development practices in mind.
    Best practices suggest one environment per project, which is the State Tool’s default option.
    State Tool was developed from the ground up with modern software development practices in mind.
    [[BR]]
ppm_convert_create_question:
  other: |
    PPM functionality is being replaced by the State Tool, which does things differently. For example, before you can
    start managing dependencies, you need to create a new virtual environment for your Perl project.
