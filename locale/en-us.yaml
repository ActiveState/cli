tutorial_newproject_intro:
  other: |
    The State Tool lets you create and maintain a set of virtual environments (eg., one per project), allowing you to
    isolate and better manage language versions and dependencies on a per-project basis.
    [[BR]][[BR]]
    For every virtual environment, you'll be able to share the current configuration (language version & dependencies)
    with your teammates so everyone stays in sync, as well as share secrets (or store your own, for your eyes only),
    set up shared scripts, and much more.
    [[BR]][[BR]]
    We'll help you create your first virtual environment, after that you can create as many as you want by running
    `state init`.

    [[BR]][[BR]]
    To start using your project simply run `[BOLD][BLUE]state activate[/RESET]` from your project directory at [BOLD][BLUE]{{.Dir}}[/RESET].
    You can also manage your project in your browser at [BOLD][BLUE]{{.URL}}[/RESET].

ppm_convert_after_tutorial:
  other: |
    For your convenience you can continue to use ppm commands once you've activated your virtual runtime environment.
    We'll give you handy tips on how your commands map to State Tool so you can learn as you go.
ppm_convert_explanation:
  other: |
    State Tool, like Perl 7, is being developed from the ground up with modern software development practices in mind.
    Best practices suggest one environment per project, which is the State Tool’s default option.
    State Tool was developed from the ground up with modern software development practices in mind.
    [[BR]]
ppm_convert_create_question:
  other: |
    PPM functionality is being replaced by the State Tool, which does things differently. For example, before you can
    start managing dependencies, you need to create a new virtual environment for your Perl project.

    We understand your need to do things traditionally, but we currently do not support it. We'd love to hear more about
