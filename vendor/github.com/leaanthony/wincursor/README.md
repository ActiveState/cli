# WinCursor

This is a simple library to show/hide the cursor in the windows terminal. Works in both Command Prompt and PowerShell.

## Installation

```
go get -u github.com/leaanthony/wincursor
```

## Usage

It's pretty simple really...

```
import github.com/leaanthony/wincursor"

func main() {
    wincursor.Hide() // This will hide the cursor
    wincursor.Show() // This will show the cursor
}
```

## Rationale

I was making a cross-platform spinner and wanted to hide the cursor on Windows. This turned out to be a lot harder than it should have been. Once I got it working, I decided to pull out the relevant functions into a new package so others don't need to go through the same pain ðŸ˜€

## With a little help from my friends

Original idea from this awesome [stackoverflow answer].

Some code on how to implement that from [go-ansiterm].
